# AIEWF 2026 — Instructor Guide
## "Vector → Hybrid → Do You Even Need a Model?"

**Event:** AI Engineer World's Fair 2026
**Date:** June 29, 2026
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Instructor:** Jeff Vestal (jeff.vestal@elastic.co)
**Co-presenter:** Philipp Krenn (confirm scope sync — see Open Items)

---

## Workshop Overview

**Thesis:** Most of a RAG pipeline is a database problem, not a model problem.

The arc:
1. Vector search feels like magic — semantic matching without keywords
2. Vector breaks on exact tokens (version numbers, error codes, setting names)
3. BM25 rescues exact tokens but fails on vocabulary mismatch (paraphrases)
4. Hybrid (RRF + linear) wins on both simultaneously
5. Wire the retriever to an LLM — retrieval quality determines answer quality, not the model

**Interface:**
- Labs 1–3: Kibana Dev Console (retriever DSL is cleanest here)
- Lab 4: Python notebook (synthesis requires a model call — console can't do that)
- One Elasticsearch Serverless backend for both

### Short version — one line per lab

**The thesis:** in RAG, retrieval quality — not the model — determines answer quality.

- **Lab 1 — Vector Search:** Run semantic queries and see how Elastic generates embeddings (Jina v5) to match on *meaning*, not keywords.
- **Lab 2 — Where Vector Breaks:** Find the queries that break semantic *and* the ones that break BM25 — and read the scores to see why neither is safe alone.
- **Lab 3 — Hybrid Search:** Fuse BM25 + semantic with RRF (and linear) into one retriever that wins on every query type that broke the others — then measure the win with an MRR weight-sweep and a strategies×queries heatmap.
- **Lab 4 — Why It Matters:** Wire hybrid retrieval to an LLM, prove that same model + worse retrieval = worse answer, then ship the multi-hop agent in Elastic Agent Builder.
- **Lab 5 — Reranking (bonus, notebook-only):** Add a precision layer on top of hybrid — call the rerank API directly, compare **pointwise (cross-encoder) vs. listwise** rerankers (Jina v2 vs. v3), and learn when a rerank stage is worth it.

**By the end:** you can build and tune a production hybrid retriever, explain why each method fails where it does, and show that retrieval — not the model — is where RAG answer quality is won.

### Longer version — what each challenge teaches

**Lab 1 — Vector Search: the thing everyone reaches for**
- *You'll do:* Run semantic queries against a `semantic_text` field; inspect the embedding endpoint, the index mapping, and how a document is chunked and vectorized at index time.
- *Outcome:* You can run vector search and explain where the embeddings come from — no client-side embedding code.

**Lab 2 — Where Vector Breaks (and lexical's own gap)**
- *You'll do:* Fire adversarial queries at both retrievers and read the BM25 `explain` output (`boost × idf × tf`) to see *why* each ranked the way it did.
- *Outcome:* You can predict which retriever fails on which query shape — semantic *blurs* exact identifiers, BM25 picks the *wrong* exact match on a boosted title and *buries* paraphrases — and why neither is safe alone.

**Lab 3 — Hybrid Search: best of both**
- *You'll do:* Compose BM25 + semantic under an RRF retriever, then a linear retriever with MinMax normalization and tunable weights; re-run every Lab 2 trap through the hybrid. Then **measure** it: sweep the linear weights, score each by MRR over a judgment set, and render a strategies×queries heatmap where RRF is the only all-green row.
- *Outcome:* You can build a production hybrid retriever, run a weight-tuning eval against a judgment set, and choose RRF vs. linear deliberately — including seeing a query where the "obvious" weight choice backfires and why the best linear weight goes stale.

**Lab 4 — Why It Matters for Agents**
- *You'll do:* Wire the hybrid retriever to an LLM (Elastic Inference Service), run the same question with good vs. deliberately wrong retrieval, add citation prompting, build a hand-rolled multi-hop agent, then **rebuild that same agent in Elastic Agent Builder** — a hybrid-search tool + a multi-hop agent you drive in the Kibana UI.
- *Outcome:* You can build a RAG pipeline, explain why retrieval — not the model — bounds answer quality, see where RBAC/DLS enforce access at the credential (not the prompt), and ship a multi-hop agent in Agent Builder whose retriever is the very one you built in Lab 3.

**Lab 5 — Reranking (bonus, notebook-only)**
- *You'll do:* Take a hybrid candidate set and add a **rerank** stage — call the rerank inference API directly, contrast a **pointwise cross-encoder (Jina Reranker v2)** with a **listwise reranker (Jina Reranker v3)** head-to-head on a near-duplicate pair, and wire the production `text_similarity_reranker` retriever.
- *Outcome:* You can explain what reranking is and the two-stage recall→precision pattern, choose pointwise vs. listwise deliberately, and decide when a rerank stage is worth adding (and when stage-1 is already crisp enough to skip it).

**Overall, by the end you can:**
- Run semantic, lexical, and hybrid retrieval in Elasticsearch and explain the mechanics of each
- Diagnose *why* a given query succeeds or fails on each method
- Build and tune a production hybrid retriever (RRF + linear) that wins across query types
- Wire retrieval to an LLM and demonstrate that retrieval quality bounds answer quality

## Pre-Event Checklist

Work through this at least 72h before the event. All items are blocking unless marked optional.

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Serverless project provisioned** — one Elastic Serverless project for the instructor demo; Instruqt provisions one per attendee automatically
- [ ] **EIS inference endpoint available** — run `GET _inference` and confirm `.jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` is listed
- [ ] **Jina Reranker v2 available** — run `GET _inference` and confirm `.jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual` (or equivalent) is listed. Note exact inference_id and update the reranker snippet in `instruqt/03-hybrid-search/queries.md` if different.
- [ ] **Run ingest.py** — `ES_ENDPOINT=... ES_API_KEY=... python corpus/ingest.py` — verify all 62 docs indexed, test semantic query returns results

### Corpus Validation (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **Run each Lab 2 trap query** against the real index and confirm the ranks in `corpus/TRAP_QUERY_VALIDATION.md` still hold (they were recorded live; re-verify if the corpus or model changed).
- [ ] **Verify the `exit code 137` near-tie** — semantic must rank doc-007 #1 by a *thin* margin over distractor doc-061 (BM25 must rank doc-007 #1 decisively). If doc-007 is no longer a near-tie, re-check the distractor docs (doc-061/doc-062).
- [ ] **Verify the paraphrase trap (doc-049)** — "notify me when something goes wrong" must rank doc-049 #1 via semantic and bury it (~#5) via BM25.
- [ ] **Run all trap queries through RRF hybrid** — confirm RRF lands the target at #1 on every one (see the Lab 3 table in `TRAP_QUERY_VALIDATION.md`).
- [ ] **Run Lab 1 "wow" queries** — "securing cluster traffic", "how do I back up my cluster data" — confirm satisfying semantic results.

### Lab 4 (Notebook)

- [ ] **HARD GATE: Instruqt notebook-tab availability** — verify whether the Instruqt sandbox can expose a notebook/code-server tab alongside Kibana against the Serverless project. The answer determines the Lab 4 in-room format:
  - Option 1 (preferred): Instruqt notebook tab — attendees run the notebook themselves
  - Option 2 (fallback): instructor-driven notebook on screen — attendees follow along
  - Option 3 (last resort): skip the notebook, show a single Python snippet in console
  - **Decide before the event and update the Lab 4 assignment.md and track.yml accordingly**
- [ ] **Pre-run Cell 5 (good context)** — verify it produces a clear, accurate answer about Watcher alerting ("How do I get notified when something goes wrong in my cluster?"). Context + answer are pre-baked, but confirm the LLM call returns.
- [ ] **Pre-run Cell 6 (bad context)** — same question, deliberately off-topic context (ILM/snapshots/pipelines); verify the model answers "I don't have enough information"
- [ ] **Pre-run Cell 7 (full pipeline)** — verify end-to-end retrieve → synthesize works live (uncached)
- [ ] **Verify Lab 3 heatmap renders** — confirm matplotlib is installed in the sandbox boot and the MRR weight-sweep cell prints sane numbers (BM25 ~0.675, Semantic ~0.875, RRF 1.000; best linear around sem 0.6–0.7)
- [ ] **Verify Lab 4 Part 2 (Agent Builder)** — run `agent-builder/setup_agent.py` and confirm the tool, **skill** (Diagnose and Fix), and agent all report created (the skill step is non-fatal — a `⚠` means that build lacks the skills API, attach it in the UI instead); run the converse cell on the two-part question and confirm ≥2 retrieval hops appear in the output (plus a `load_skill` step). Note: Agent Builder and Workflows must be enabled on the Serverless project (verified on the vector-optimized project).

### Pacing

- [ ] **Pacing dry-run** — run through all 4 labs against the real index. Time each lab. Confirm 10/25/25/40/20 holds with buffer. If Lab 3 runs long, cut the `rank_constant` tuning experiment (it's optional).

## Open Items / Human-Gated

These require human action before the event:

1. **Instruqt notebook-tab check** (HARD GATE) — does the sandbox support a notebook tab alongside Kibana against one Serverless project? Determines Lab 4 in-room format. Jeff or Philipp must test this before build.

2. **Scope confirmation with Philipp Krenn** — the search/retrieval angle (per `projects/aiewf-2026-ai-search-workshop.md`). Confirm co-presenter role and any content changes.

3. **EIS model IDs** — confirm exact inference IDs for Jina v5 embedding and Jina Reranker v2 in the provisioned Serverless project. Update `corpus/ingest.py` and queries if different from defaults.

4. **Corpus trap query pre-test** — must be run against the REAL index (not assumed). Fill in `corpus/TRAP_QUERY_VALIDATION.md` before the event.

## Presenter Notes by Lab

### Intro (~10 min)

- Name the EIS/Jina framing upfront. This audience knows Jina. Don't bury it.
- The "how does the embedding get generated?" question is your hook. Set it up before Lab 1 answers it.
- Orient the sandbox: show Kibana Dev Console, show the index exists, mention the corpus is pre-indexed.

### Lab 1 (~25 min)

- Do Snippet 1 (mapping) together, explain `semantic_text` + `inference_id`
- Do Snippet 2 (GET inference endpoint) — "this is real infrastructure, not hand-waving"
- Walk the query-time embedding mechanism before running Snippet 3
- Run Snippets 3-5, ask attendees to call out what they notice
- End on a hook: "Why would you ever use keyword search?"

### Lab 2 (~25 min)

- Part A: run A1-A3, let attendees guess the results before revealing them
- Part B: rerun the same queries as BM25 — the contrast is the teaching moment
- Part C: the paraphrase query is the highest-risk moment. Have the output pre-run in a buffer if possible. Never demo this cold.

### Lab 3 (~40 min)

- Build the RRF retriever step by step, don't paste the full query at once
- "RRF doesn't care about score magnitude — only rank position" — say this twice
- After attendees build RRF, have them re-run the Lab 2 trap queries. Watch the room when hybrid wins all 4 simultaneously.
- Linear: explain MinMax normalization before showing the query. "Scores are on different scales — MinMax makes them comparable."
- Reranker: instructor-run only, talk through what it does and why it's not in the hands-on
- After the rank-of-target table, the notebook runs an MRR weight-sweep (BM25/semantic weights across the judgment set) and renders a strategies×queries heatmap. Teaching beat: "the best linear weight only ties RRF *after* you measure it — and it goes stale when the corpus changes. RRF needs zero tuning."

### Lab 4 (~25 min)

- Frame the pipeline before opening the notebook: retrieve → build prompt → generate
- Cell 5 (good context): read the answer aloud, point to the specific Watcher trigger/condition/action content it grounded on
- Cell 6 (bad context): pause before running. "Same question. Same model. Same prompt. Watch." — the model returns "I don't have enough information"
- After Cell 6: "The model didn't get dumber. The retrieval got worse." — this is the closing line.
- Cell 7: if time allows, take a question from the audience and run it live through the full pipeline
- The security section is now two parts: an app `bool.filter` is **not** access control (say so explicitly); RBAC/DLS enforce on the credential's role. The DLS code is shown but not run — the sandbox's managed API key can't mint a restricted child key.
- Part 2 (closer): attendees build the same multi-hop agent in Agent Builder — the Lab 3 RRF retriever registered as an ES|QL tool, a Diagnose and Fix skill, wired to an agent, run via the converse API, then they tour the agent (Tool / Skills / Custom instructions) and drive it in the Kibana UI. Teaching beat: "same retriever, three abstraction levels — the agent framework is swappable, retrieval quality is not."

## Corpus Trap Docs Quick Reference

> **Result display:** queries `_source` `["id", "title", "summary"]` — each doc has a one-line
> neutral `summary` so attendees can see what a hit is about without reading the full body.
> `trap_type` (column below) is the instructor-facing classification; it is kept in the corpus
> and used as a retrieval filter in Lab 4, but is **not** shown in learner-facing query results.
> Non-trap docs have `trap_type: null`.

| Doc ID | Title | Trap Type | Trap Query — verified behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| doc-007 | JVM settings for Elasticsearch | exact-token | "exit code 137" — semantic #1 but a near-tie (blur); BM25 decisive |
| doc-061 | Container exit codes when a process is killed | distractor | crowds doc-007 on "exit code 137" (no literal "137") |
| doc-062 | Troubleshooting application crashes and restarts | distractor | second crowding distractor for "exit code 137" |
| doc-008 | Cluster shard allocation settings | exact-token | "new_primaries" — semantic returns WRONG doc; BM25 pins doc-008 |
| doc-057 | Elasticsearch 8.18 release notes | version-specific | "8.18 breaking changes" — BM25 ranks WRONG doc (doc-006); semantic wins |
| doc-006 | Elasticsearch breaking changes (9.x) | version-specific | the boosted-title doc BM25 wrongly prefers on "8.18 breaking changes" |
| doc-049 | Elasticsearch Watcher alerting | paraphrase target | "notify me when something goes wrong" — semantic #1, BM25 buries it; also the Lab 4 RAG good-context example |
| doc-001 | SAML authentication troubleshooting | paraphrase | "configure SAML authentication" — the good-context RAG example in `notebooks/lab4-rag-pipeline.ipynb` |
| doc-009 / doc-010 | Security setup / TLS for cluster comms | near-duplicate | paired near-duplicates |
